# Mock Portfolio

## Description
This is my first voyage at creating a portfolio from scratch! I wanted to create this webpage to test my knowledge on a variety of newly learned topics like HTML, CSS, and responsiveness. While creating this project I learned the importance of semantic elements, descriptive attribute naming, and spacing.
